# Flight-Delay-Prediction

## Description 

A two stage predictive machine learning engine that forecasts the on-time performance of commercial fights by predicting the delay is developed. Flight information of US Domestic fights along with weather data of various airports across USA are analyzed and processed. Using classifers, they are classifed as delayed or not to calculate the delay in minutes for the delayed fights using regressors.

The pipeline architecture to calculate the delay using ML models is illustrated below.
